Revision history for Acme-MetaSyntactic

1.009 Mon Aug 12 2013
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Test::MetaSyntactic now enforces stricter rules on themes:
          a theme will fail if it is empty, or if it returns the empty
          string as a name

1.008 Sun Jan 13 2013
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - the load_data() method now closes the DATA filehandle when done.
          Many themes use __DATA__ to store their names, which could cause
          problems ("Too many open files"), when loading a lot of themes.
          (see http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/25449004)

1.007 Mon Oct  8 2012
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Test::MetaSyntactic now supports RELEASE_TESTING
          (and keeps supporting AUTHOR_TESTING for backwards compatibility)

1.006 Sun Aug 26 2012
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - add support for end-of-line comments in the __DATA__ section
          (in the load_data() method)

1.005 Tue Jul 24 2012
        [TESTS]

1.003 Tue Jun 12 2012
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Acme::MetaSyntactic::List now automatically removes duplicate
          items from the initialisation data,
        - thus making obsolete the subtest_uniq test in Test::MetaSyntactic
        - give Test::MetaSyntactic a shorter timeout to check for the network
        - fix some encoding issues (fixes RT #77657)

1.002 Mon May 21 2012
        [TESTS]
        - ensure theme names used in tests are unlikely to conflict
          with themes existing in the wild

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - new subtest in Test::MetaSyntactic: subtest_encoding
        - extract() for MultiList lists that have remote lists
          can now behave differently for each category (the category
          is passed as a parameter)

        - add links to meta(1) from Acme::MetaSyntactic's documentation
          (fixes RT #77060)

        [OOPS]

        - pie (Nicholas Clark)
        [TESTS]
        - removed t/41count.t from the public tests, as it may break
          when older versions of Acme::MetaSyntactic are already installed

        [THEME UPDATES]
        - apollo (augmented and renamed space_missions)

        - Acme::MetaSyntactic::Alias improves lazyness by allowing a

        - You know the story, now... (If not, see the change log for
          versions 0.26, 0.38 and 0.55.) This time I turned a simple
          list into one with categories.
        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - New behaviour Acme::MetaSyntactic::MultiList allows themes
          to be organised in categories and sub-categories. Usage is
          similar to Acme::MetaSyntactic::Locale (except that the
          constructor parameter is named 'category')
        - the first theme to use this feature is... pornstars
        - Acme::MetaSyntactic::RemoteList has a new method sources()
          that can report the source URLs for subcategories (for
          Acme::MetaSyntactic::RemoteList)
        - the meta script accepts a new --category option, to select
          a category within an Acme::MetaSyntactic::MultiList theme
        [TESTS]
        - Since 0.59, Acme::MetaSyntactic::RemoteList could accept
          serveral sources. This functionality is now fully tested.

        - weekdays
        [HEY, WEEKDAYS IS NOT NEW! IT WAS ADDED IN VERSION 0.51!!]
        - Well, the theme has changed enough that I can consider it
          new: it's now a subclass of Acme::MetaSyntactic::Locale
          and supports Basque, Catalan, Corsican, Danish, Dutch, English,
          Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Latin, Latvian,
          Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Welsh and Yiddish
          lists (as well as the Pataphysical calendar).
        - You've being doing this three times already! What does it mean?
        - I must admit that it's the only way I've found to add something
          new each week and still manage to have only 100 themes when I
          reach version 1.00...

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Added support for empty lists (prevents AMS from falling into
          an infinite loop), thanks to Abigail
        - Better support in Acme::MetaSyntactic::Locale for language
          tags longer than 2 characters

        - Acme::MetaSyntactic::List and Acme::MetaSyntactic::Locale-based
          theme can now supply their lists to __PACKAGE__->init(), instead
          of storing them in __DATA__. The data format must be the same
          as the one that load_data() returns.
        [FILE UPDATE]
        - Oops. The DATES file was not listed in the MANIFEST file, 
          and therefore not included in version 0.49.

        - A new class, Acme::MetaSyntactic::RemoteList, makes it possible
          to fetch the source list for the theme from a given URL.
          The associated test script spots new items and warns me about it.
        - The first themes with a remote list are viclones, dilbert and
          pm_groups.
        - meta now has a --remote option that prints the remote list of items
        [NEW FILE]

          Using any Acme::MetaSyntactic::theme with the empty list () will

        [COVERAGE]

0.12 Sun Mar  6 20:15:11 CET 2005
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - To prevent endless growth of the Acme::MetaSyntactic module,
          and support various theme behaviours, support for behaviour
          classes has been added.
        - The first behaviour class is Acme::MetaSyntactic::List, which
          reproduces the previous behaviour of selecting a number
          of random items from a list, with no repetition until
          the list is exhausted.
        - The 17 existing themes have been converted to the new scheme.
        [USAGE]
        - Acme::MetaSyntactic is a dependency for a least one module!
          Praise Bot::MetaSyntactic, which is the core of the meta bot
          running on irc://irc.perl.org/perlfr
        [INCOMPATIBILITIES]
        - the API has changed a little:
          + Acme::MetaSyntactic does not has methods named after the
            themes any more
          + The name() method now accept the theme name as its first
            parameter
          + name( [ $theme, ] 0 ) now returns the full list of names
        [COVERAGE]
        - Code coverage is still 100%, but I had to resort to a hack
          to achieve this feat.
        [NEW BEHAVIOURS]
        - Acme::MetaSyntactic::List is the classic "random item from a list"
          that existed until now
        [ANNOUNCE]
        - More behaviour subclasses will follow!
