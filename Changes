        [TESTS FIX]

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Acme::MetaSyntactic::Alias improves lazyness by allowing a
          theme to be the exact copy of another one, with no work
          (the colors theme is an alias of the colours theme)
        [THEME UPDATE]
        - colours (Abigail provided many English color names)

          0.26, 0.38, 0.55 and 0.70 for the whole list of cheap
          justifications)
        [ENHANCEMENTS]

          Acme::MetaSyntactic::MultiList, and supports territories.

        [NEW WEEKLY THEME 2006/04/17]
        - jamesbond (Abigail)
        [HEY, JAMESBOND IS NOT NEW! IT WAS ADDED IN VERSION 0.07!!]
        - You know the story, now... (If not, see the change log for
          versions 0.26, 0.38 and 0.55.) This time I turned a simple
          list into one with categories.
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - The meta script can now be called with "meta theme/category"
          instead of "meta --category category theme". (Abigail)
        - meta now accepts a --sources switch, that lists the sources
          used by a remote list. (Abigail)

        - pornstars (Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni)
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - New behaviour Acme::MetaSyntactic::MultiList allows themes
          to be organised in categories and sub-categories. Usage is
          similar to Acme::MetaSyntactic::Locale (except that the
          constructor parameter is named 'category')
        - the first theme to use this feature is... pornstars
        - Acme::MetaSyntactic::RemoteList has a new method sources()
          that can report the source URLs for subcategories (for
          Acme::MetaSyntactic::RemoteList)
        - the meta script accepts a new --category option, to select
          a category within an Acme::MetaSyntactic::MultiList theme
        [TESTS]
        - Since 0.59, Acme::MetaSyntactic::RemoteList could accept
          serveral sources. This functionality is now fully tested.
        - tests for Acme::MetaSyntactic::MultiList
        - skip a few more tests if LWP::UserAgent is not installed

        [HEY, WEEKDAYS IS NOT NEW! IT WAS ADDED IN VERSION 0.51!!]
        - Well, the theme has changed enough that I can consider it
          new: it's now a subclass of Acme::MetaSyntactic::Locale
          and supports Basque, Catalan, Corsican, Danish, Dutch, English,
          Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Latin, Latvian,
          Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Welsh and Yiddish
          lists (as well as the Pataphysical calendar).
        - You've being doing this three times already! What does it mean?
        - I must admit that it's the only way I've found to add something
          new each week and still manage to have only 100 themes when I
          reach version 1.00...

          as the one that load_data() returns.
        [FILE UPDATE]
        - Oops. The DATES file was not listed in the MANIFEST file, 
          and therefore not included in version 0.49.

        - The first themes with a remote list are viclones, dilbert and
          pm_groups.

          lists (as well as the good old NATO).

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Correctly defined the import() method for each AMS subclass.
          Using any Acme::MetaSyntactic::theme with the empty list () will
          now prevent the metatheme() function to be created.

        - Coverage is not 100% any more (99.6% under Linux and 99.4% under

        [HEY, SIMPSONS IS NOT NEW! IT WAS ADDED IN VERSION 0.04!!]
        - Sorry, the theme disappeared in version 0.12, when I made
          the change to the behaviour-based architecture
        - What's the point of having 100% coverage, when things like
          this happen?
        - Hey, nobody complained until now!

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - Acme::MetaSyntactic::any's constructor now accepts parameters,

        - Acme::MetaSyntactic::any now ensures there will be no repetition
          in a given theme until all items from the theme have been seen.
        [DOCUMENTATION]
        - Acme::MetaSyntactic::Locale is now listed among the available
          behaviours in Acme::MetaSyntactic

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - now looks for Acme::MetaSyntactic themes everywhere in @INC
          (not only in the directory where Acme::MetaSyntactic is installed)
        - better documentation for Acme::MetaSyntactic::Locale
        [BUGFIX]
        - load_data() does not destroy $_ any more
        - the bugfix in 0.16 did not fix the "whitespace in install dir" bug,
          but the @INC enhancement did (thanks to Olivier Mengué for pointing
          me to File::Glob)

        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - The new Acme::MetaSyntactic::Locale allows for multilingual themes
        - The first theme to use this behaviour is "haddock"
        - Still 100% coverage (even cover Win32 code under Unix)
        [BUGFIX]
        - Corrected a bug that only appeared if Acme::MetaSyntactic
          was installed in directories containing whitespace
          (thanks to Max Maischein for testing under such conditions!)

        - loremipsum (Jérôme Fenal)

0.12 Sun Mar  6 20:15:11 CET 2005
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - To prevent endless growth of the Acme::MetaSyntactic module,
          and support various theme behaviours, support for behaviour
          classes has been added.
        - The first behaviour class is Acme::MetaSyntactic::List, which
          reproduces the previous behaviour of selecting a number
          of random items from a list, with no repetition until
          the list is exhausted.
        - The 17 existing themes have been converted to the new scheme.
        [USAGE]
        - Acme::MetaSyntactic is a dependency for a least one module!
          Praise Bot::MetaSyntactic, which is the core of the meta bot
          running on irc://irc.perl.org/perlfr
        [INCOMPATIBILITIES]
        - the API has changed a little:
          + Acme::MetaSyntactic does not has methods named after the
            themes any more
          + The name() method now accept the theme name as its first
            parameter
          + name( [ $theme, ] 0 ) now returns the full list of names
        [COVERAGE]
        - Code coverage is still 100%, but I had to resort to a hack
          to achieve this feat.
        [NEW BEHAVIOURS]
        - Acme::MetaSyntactic::List is the classic "random item from a list"
          that existed until now
        [ANNOUNCE]
        - More behaviour subclasses will follow!
        [NEW WEEKLY THEMES 2005/03/07]
        - any     [a metatheme (!) that returns names from a random theme]
        - dancers [a birthday gift and homage to my wife,
                   who was born on March 7th, 30 years ago]
        [THEME UPDATE]

        [BIG FUX]
        - themes() didn't work correctly in scalar context.
        [SMILL FAX]
        - meta did issue a warning when called without arguments.
          Rafael Garcia-Suarez provided a patch, which I modified
          so that no args means default theme.
        [NEW WEEKLY THEME 2005/01/24]
        - tld (Scott Lanning suggested ISO 3166 country codes)

0.05 Sun Jan 16 18:30:29 CET 2005
        [ANNOUNCE]
        - From now on, releases should happen on a weekly
          basis, every monday morning (CET)... A new list every week!
        - Email me with suggestions (and lists).
        [STUPID ME]
        - 0.04 was released too soon, so this version:
          + puts the coverage back at 100% (one missing test in 0.04
            had the coverage fall to 97.8%. Darn.)
          + removes the compromising "log" file (which was there since 0.01)
          + removes the "Build" file (which was there since 0.01, as well)
        [TOOLS]
        - script/meta is a simple front-end, useful with $EDITOR
        [THEMES]

          as requested, as randomly as possible.
