1.003 2012-06-12 BOOK

    - fix some encoding issues (fixes RT #77657)

    - The first themes with a remote list are viclones, dilbert and
      pm_groups.

      and supports Swahili, French, English, German and Italian
      lists (as well as the good old NATO).

    - Coverage is not 100% any more (99.6% under Linux and 99.4% under
      Windows), but I think I'll mostly blame Devel::Cover ;-)

    [BUGFIX]
    - load_data() does not destroy $_ any more

0.12 2005-03-06 BOOK
    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    - To prevent endless growth of the Acme::MetaSyntactic module,
      and support various theme behaviours, support for behaviour
      classes has been added.
    - The first behaviour class is Acme::MetaSyntactic::List, which
      reproduces the previous behaviour of selecting a number
      of random items from a list, with no repetition until
      the list is exhausted.
    - The 17 existing themes have been converted to the new scheme.
    [USAGE]
    - Acme::MetaSyntactic is a dependency for a least one module!
      Praise Bot::MetaSyntactic, which is the core of the meta bot
      running on irc://irc.perl.org/perlfr
    [INCOMPATIBILITIES]
    - the API has changed a little:
      + Acme::MetaSyntactic does not has methods named after the
        themes any more
      + The name() method now accept the theme name as its first
        parameter
      + name( [ $theme, ] 0 ) now returns the full list of names
    [COVERAGE]
    - Code coverage is still 100%, but I had to resort to a hack
      to achieve this feat.
    [NEW BEHAVIOURS]
    - Acme::MetaSyntactic::List is the classic "random item from a list"
      that existed until now
    [ANNOUNCE]
    - More behaviour subclasses will follow!
    [NEW WEEKLY THEMES 2005/03/07]
    - any     [a metatheme (!) that returns names from a random theme]

    - Email me with suggestions (and lists).
    [STUPID ME]
    - 0.04 was released too soon, so this version:
      + puts the coverage back at 100% (one missing test in 0.04
        had the coverage fall to 97.8%. Darn.)
      + removes the compromising "log" file (which was there since 0.01)
      + removes the "Build" file (which was there since 0.01, as well)
