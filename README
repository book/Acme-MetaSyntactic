Acme::MetaSyntactic - Themed metasyntactic variables

DESCRIPTION

When writing code examples, it's always easy at the beginning:

    my $foo = "bar";
    $foo .= "baz";   # barbaz

But one gets quickly stuck with the same old boring examples. Does it
have to be this way? I say "No".

Here is Acme::MetaSyntactic, designed to fulfill your metasyntactic
needs. No more will you scratch your head in search of a good variable
name!

UPDATES

From January 2005 to November 2006, I have published a CPAN distribution
a week, including new themes for Acme::MetaSyntactic (almost) every week.

With the version 1.000 of Acme::MetaSyntactic (published on May 7, 2012),
I have split the core modules (the ones that provide the list behaviour)
from the actual themes, making the distribution containing the very
stable Acme::MetaSyntactic modules driving its behaviour a lot thinner.

If you think a important list is missing from the module, you should
be able to make a distribution for it yourself. To ensure correctness,
include the following test script in your t/ directory:

    use Test::MetaSyntactic;
    all_themes_ok();

If you think something's missing from a list distributed with
Acme-MetaSyntatic-Themes, please send me a patch against that
distribution.

INSTALL
